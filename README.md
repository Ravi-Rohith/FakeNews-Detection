This is a project to train a model that detects Fake News. The model is made by comparing the accuracy of multiple models and given a accuracy boost up using Intel OneTool for AI Development which specialize in improving the speed and accuracy of the models.

The Fakenews Dataset used for this model can be downloaded here. https://onlineacademiccommunity.uvic.ca/isot/2022/11/27/fake-news-detection-datasets/
